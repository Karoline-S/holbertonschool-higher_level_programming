**Mandatory Tasks: Python**

0. Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

2. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on task 1) private instance attribute: size, instantiation with optional size: size must be an int, otherwise raise TyepError exception, size must be 0 or greater, otherwise raise ValueError exception.
3. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on task 2) private instance attribute: size, instantiation with optional size (size must be an int, size must be 0 or greater), public instance method

5. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on task 4) private instance attribute: size (with getter and setter), instantiation with optional size (size must be an int, size must be 0 or greater), public instance method that prints to stdout.
6. Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on task 4) private instance attribute: size (with getter and setter), private instance attribute: position (with getter and setter), instantiation with optional size (size must be an int, size must be 0 or greater), public instance method that prints to stdout.
